# Once upon a time at BakerLi...

It has long been a dream of mine to open my own BakerLi (either as part of my AirbnLi, or as a sister shop of the bottle store Li-Cure :p). The BakerLi will be either on the highland of Scotland or in a rural town in the South Island of New Zealand.

Before the dream becomes a reality, this is where my tried and tested baking recipes will be hosted :)
