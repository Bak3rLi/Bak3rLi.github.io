# Once upon a time at BakerLi...

It has long been a dream of mine to open my own BakerLi (very likely as part of my AirbnLi, where fresh baked goods are served alongside with my signature LiCure). The BakerLi will be either on the highland of Scotland or in a rural town in the South Island of New Zealand.

Before the dream becomes a reality, this is where my tried and tested baking recipes will be hosted :)
