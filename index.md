Xin chào! Yaama!

I am a sociolinguist specialising in language variation and change, contact linguistics, corpus linguistics. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in migrant bilingual settings. My interest in Linguistics is however diverse, and I have written on a wide range of topics, including (quantitative) variationist linguistics, (qualitative) discourse analysis, corpus management, field methods and Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkits for spoken varieties of low-resource languages. 

Currently, I am a final year PhD candidate in Linguistics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). My PhD, fully funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/), explores language variation and change across generations in the [Canberra](https://www.britannica.com/place/Australian-Capital-Territory#ref960967) Vietnamese community, using an original, natural corpus of spontaneous speech (the Canberra Vietnamese-English Code-switching Corpus/CanVEC). My research specifically considers speakers' variation in both monolingual and bilingual discourse, and asks what these structural differences mean in the broader context of language shift and language change in contact communities. 

Before Cambridge, I completed a [Master of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/VLING) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](http://www.anu.edu.au/), and also a [Bachelor of Arts](https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=922AA&version_number=3) (Honours I) at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/). 

I am also an Affiliate Member of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/) and a Linguistics Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/). Before that, I was an editor for [Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics (COPiL)](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/COPIL/), and a Visitor and a Research Assistant at [ANU School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics](http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/), where I worked on an [IAFPA](https://www.iafpa.net/)-funded project on forensic voice comparison. 

I am particularly interested in projects to do with language contact, language variation and change, non-canonical forms of language, world Englishes, migrant language repertoire and English training for refugees and asylum seekers.
