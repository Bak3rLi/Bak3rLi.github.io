# About

Xin chào! Yaama! 

<img src="boat.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right">

I am a final year PhD candidate in Linguistics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am broadly interested in language variation and change, socio-linguistics, corpus linguistics, and Natural Language Processing toolkits for spoken varieties of low-resourced languages. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in migrant bilingual communities. My PhD, fully funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/), explores code-switching patterns across generations in Vietnamese-English bilingual discourse, using an original, naturalistic corpus of first and second generation speakers in Canberra, Australia (CanVEC). 

Before Cambridge, I completed a [Master of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/VLING) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](http://www.anu.edu.au/) on the variation of kin terms as personal pronouns in Vietnamese-English mixed speech, and also a Bachelor of Arts (Honours I, Communication) on the use of metaphors in Australian news media reporting of maritime asylum seekers, at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/).

I am also an Affiliate Member of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/), and a Linguistic Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/), where I oversee its project on the first bidirectional dictionary (English-Vietnamese-English) and engineer several international research collaborations, most recently with [Hongkong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html) on borrowed words in East Asian languages. Previously I was also a Visitor and a Research Assistant at the School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics at ANU, where I worked on an [IAFPA](https://www.iafpa.net/)-funded project on forensic voice comparison in Vietnamese. 

I am particularly interested in projects to do with migrant language repertoire and English training for refugees and asylum seekers. 

# Projects

In collaboration with Dr. Christopher Bryant at the Cambridge Computer Lab, I developed a toolkit to semi-automate language marking, POS tagging and translations for intra-sentential code-switched data. This work has recently been awarded a grant by the Cambridge Language Sciences Incubator Fund to further develop and extend its applicability to other language pairs. The project will be co-led by Dr. Theresa Biberauer, Dr. Christopher Bryant, and Sana Kidwai, and the ultimate goal is to create a standardised code-switching corpus of multiple language pairs, where researchers can freely access a large amount of comparable, consistently transcribed and coded data for future research. 

I am also initiating a research program to systematically investigate refuguee- and migrant- learners' needs, thereby developing better teaching and learning materials that can specifically cater for this minority group of speakers.
