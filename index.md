# About

Xin chào! Yaama! 

<img id="my-picture" src="boat.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right">

I am a final year PhD candidate in Linguistics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am broadly interested in language variation and change, socio-linguistics, corpus linguistics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkits for spoken varieties of low-resourced languages. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in migrant bilingual communities. My PhD, fully funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/), explores code-switching patterns across generations in Vietnamese-English bilingual discourse, using an original, naturalistic corpus of first and second generation speakers in [Canberra, Australia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Australian-Capital-Territory#ref960967) (i.e. the Canberra Vietnamese-English Code-switching Corpus/CanVEC). 

Before Cambridge, I completed a [Master of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/VLING) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](http://www.anu.edu.au/) on the variation of kin terms as personal pronouns in Vietnamese-English mixed speech, and also a [Bachelor of Arts](https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=922AA&version_number=3) (Honours I, Communication) on the use of metaphors in Australian news media reporting of maritime asylum seekers, at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/).

I am also an Affiliate Member of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/), and a Linguistic Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/), where I oversee its first project on a bidirectional dictionary (English-Vietnamese-English) and engineer several international research collaborations, most recently with [Hongkong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html) on borrowed words in East Asian languages. Previously I was also an editor for [Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics (COPiL)](http://www.ling.cam.ac.uk/COPIL/), and a Visitor and a Research Assistant at [ANU School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics](http://slll.cass.anu.edu.au/), where I worked on an [IAFPA](https://www.iafpa.net/)-funded project on forensic voice comparison. 

I am particularly interested in projects to do with language contact, language variation and change in unstable, socially complex communities, migrant English, migrant language repertoire and English training for refugees and asylum seekers.
