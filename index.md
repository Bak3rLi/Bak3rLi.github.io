# About

Xin chào! Yaama! 

<img src="boat.jpg" width="300" height="300" align="right">

I am a final year PhD candidate in Linguistics at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). I am broadly interested in language variation and change, socio-linguistics, corpus linguistics, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolkits for spoken varieties of low-resourced languages. Much of my work is corpora-based and focuses on contact phenomena in migrant bilingual communities. My PhD, fully funded by the [Cambridge Trust](https://www.cambridgetrust.org/), explores code-switching patterns across generations in Vietnamese-English bilingual discourse, using an original, naturalistic corpus of first and second generation speakers in Canberra, Australia (the Canberra Vietnamese-English Code-switching Corpus/CanVEC). 

Before Cambridge, I completed a [Master of General and Applied Linguistics (Advanced)](https://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/program/VLING) at the [Australian National University (ANU)](http://www.anu.edu.au/) on the variation of kin terms as personal pronouns in Vietnamese-English mixed speech, and also a [Bachelor of Arts](https://www.canberra.edu.au/coursesandunits/course?course_cd=922AA&version_number=3) (Honours I, Communication) on the use of metaphors in Australian news media reporting of maritime asylum seekers, at the [University of Canberra](https://www.canberra.edu.au/).

I am also an Affiliate Member of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language (CoEDL)](http://www.dynamicsoflanguage.edu.au/), and a Linguistic Consultant at the [Vietnamese Lexicography Centre](http://www.vietlex.com/), where I oversee its project on the first bidirectional dictionary (English-Vietnamese-English) and engineer several international research collaborations, most recently with [Hongkong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/web/en/home/index.html) on borrowed words in East Asian languages. Previously I was also a Visitor and a Research Assistant at the School of Literature, Languages and Linguistics at ANU, where I worked on an [IAFPA](https://www.iafpa.net/)-funded project on forensic voice comparison in Vietnamese. 

I am particularly interested in projects to do with language contact, language variation and change in unstable, socially complex communities, migrant English, migrant language repertoire and English training for refugees and asylum seekers. 

# Research
## Current Projects
*Automatically standardising two multilingual code-switched corpora* 

— with [Dr Theresa Biberauer](https://www.mml.cam.ac.uk/dr-theresa-biberauer),  [Dr Christopher Bryant](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cjb255/) & Sana Kidwai

In collaboration with [Dr Christopher Bryant](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~cjb255/) at the Cambridge Computer Lab in 2018, I independently developed a tool to process CanVEC, an originally collected natural code-switched speech corpus for my PhD. Although multilingualism is now the norm, NLP-tools capable of processing more than one language per 'sentential unit' are almost non-existent. This necessarily limits important applications such as Machine Translation and Information Retrieval, and also the utility of NLP-based technology in contexts where language-users readily employ two/more languages side-by-side. We developed a Nguyen-Bryant algorithm to semi-automatically annotate the corpus with language information and part-of-speech/POS tags, obtaining a >90% accuracy rate for almost every task. 

This work has recently been awarded a grant by the [Cambridge Language Sciences Research Incubator Fund](https://www.languagesciences.cam.ac.uk/funding/language-sciences-research-incubator-fund) to further refine and extend its applicability to Hindi-English. The ultimate goal is to eventually create a standardised code-switching corpus of multiple language pairs, where researchers can freely access a large amount of comparable, consistently transcribed and tagged dataset for future research. Once in place, this linguistic repository would also be available not only for linguistic research of different kinds, but also for use in more complex downstream NLP tasks such as speech recognition of accented speech, parsing, and automated translation.

*Migrant and refugee language repertoire* 

With a long-standing interest in migrant language practice, I am putting together a research program that systematically investigates how migrant communities foster their language practice. The recent immigration ‘crisis’ in the Western world is in part a struggle of navigating the changing communities as a result of globalisation. Language as an identity and cultural marker has proved a particularly important point of contention in the midst of these changes. As people from different cultures merge, will language boundaries also evaporate? How are linguistic norms re-negotiated and re-defined during this process? 

The Migrant and Refugee Language Repertoire project aims to answer these questions and better our understanding of why and how migrant communities develop their local, or even hybrid, linguistic strategies in specific contexts. The outcome may not only inform linguistic theories, but also provide tangible, empirical evidence to further improve the practice of English teaching and language assessment for migrant and refugees speakers, a particularly challenging area yet still little is known. The situation is further complicated by the fact that this minority group of speakers all come from diverse cultural, educational and linguistic backgrounds, possibly with little or no literacy skills, ranging in age from children to senior citizens. Research output from this may help inform government language policy for migrants and refugees in the future. 

The project is in its infancy stage, and I welcome interests and collaboration.
